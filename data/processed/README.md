# Processed Indicators
This folder contains datasets for processed indicators. Each sub folder is identified by the data source (e.g. Eurostat) and contains the indicators obtained from that source. Every indicator is stored a separate file (.csv) and is accompanied by a schema (.yaml) which describes the dataset and the fields.

Each indicator csv contains four columns, with each row representing the indicator value for a specific region and point in time. The fields are:

- `year`: the year for this indicator value
- `<region_id>`: the code of the region for this indicator value e.g. UKI1- `<region_year_spec>`: the version of the regions being used for for this indicator value e.g. NUTS 2016
- `<value>`: abbreviated name of the indicator

The full set of available indicators is listed below.
