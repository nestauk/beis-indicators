File naming

pattern: theme_spatilatype_resolution_year_projection_subset.format
example: NUTS_BN_01M_2013_3035_LEVL_0.geojson

theme:
4-character code of theme (NUTS)

spatialtype: BN/RG/LB
* BN: boundaries (multilines)
* RG: regions (multipolygons)
* LB: labels (points)

resolution: 60M/20M/10M/03M/01M; map scale the data is optimized (generalized) for.

year: the year of NUTS regulation (2016/2013/2010/2006/2003). See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/history

projection: 4-digit EPSG code, see http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/
* EPSG:4326 (WGS84, coordinates in decimal degrees),
* EPSG:3035 (ETRS 1989 in Lambert Azimutal projection with centre in E52N10, coordinates in meters),
* EPSG:3857 (WGS84 Web Mercator Auxiliary Sphere, coordinates in meters)

subset: one of NUTS levels
* LEVL_0: NUTS level 0 (countries)
* LEVL_1: NUTS level 1
* LEVL_2: NUTS level 2
* LEVL_3: NUTS level 3
Each subset makes complete coverage (RG data).
No subset code - all NUTS levels are in the same file. It means quadruple coverage (RG data); any point hits 4 (or 0) polygons.

2018-05-29 NUTS 2016 release.2018-09-17 NUTS 2013 fix: NUTS changes in Norway: NO60 has been split into NO061 and NO062. CNTR 2016 fix: OTHR_CNTR_FLAG is 'F' for all records in CNTR_BN_20M_2016. Layout fix: NUTS units page should show only countries with NUTS or statistical regions defined (EU + EFTA + candidates).
2018-09-17 Formats: SVG replaces EPS as a vector format for use in web and design applications. Projections: 4258 removed, 4326 recommended instead. Fixes: NUTS 2013 changes in Norway: NO60 has been split into NO061 and NO062; CNTR 2016 attributes OTHR_CNTR_FLAG, COAS_FLAG recalculated. COMM_2016 added to release package.
