subtitle: Location quotient of employment in high tech industries based on the Business Register Employment Survey
description: This indicator measures the location quotient of employment in high tech industries based on the Business Register Employment Survey. High tech industries are defined in terms of SIC-4 (industry) codes, using the definition in "The Geography of the UK's creative and high-tech economies" (https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/geography_uks_creative_high-tech_economieswv20151.pdf) in table 6.1.3.4.
