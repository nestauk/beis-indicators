title: Travel time to nearest five road junctions (average)
subtitle: Average minimum travel time to nearest five road junctions from a LEP region for England (2011 & 2013) and Wales (2011 only)
description: Average minimum travel time to nearest five road junctions from a LEP region for England (2011 & 2013) and Wales (2011 only). Overlapping LEP regions are used therefore some calculations may be under-estimated or over-estimated.
