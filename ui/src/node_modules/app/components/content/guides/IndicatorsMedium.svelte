	<h2>Exploring the indicators</h2>

	<h3>Sidebar</h3>

	<p>
		Here you will find a list of indicators, grouped by theme sections.
		These are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public R&amp;D</li>
		<li>Knowledge exchange and university commercialisation</li>
		<li>Private R&amp;D</li>
		<li>Places attracting R&amp;D firms and workers</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Clicking on the name of an indicator will navigate to the trend page
		for that indicator.
	</p>

	<h3>Indicators page</h3>

	<h4>Temporal distribution</h4>

	<p>
		On the upper part you can see a representation of the temporal
		coverage for each available indicator.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each circle represents that data for an indicator is available for
		that year.
	</p>
	<p>
		Click on it to the navigate to that indicator for that specific
		year.
	</p>

	<h4>Timeline</h4>

	<p>
		On the lower part, the timeline shows a list of all years where
		there is data available for at least one indicator.
	</p>

	<h3>Trends page</h3>

	<h4>Trends</h4>

	<p>
		Here you will see a set of trend lines, with each line showing the
		indicator value for one NUTS2 region over time (where data is
		available).
	</p>
	<p>
		Hovering over a trend line highlights the trend and shows the value
		of the data point nearest to the pointer.
	</p>

	<h4>Timeline</h4>

	<p>
		The Timeline shows one white dot for each year that the indicator is
		available. In this view, the timeline is interactive. Clicking on a
		dot navigates to a map showing the geographic distribution of the
		indicator for that year.
	</p>

	<h4>Toolbar: regional selection</h4>

	<p>
		The trend lines shown correspond to NUTS2 regions, however it is
		possible to select and filter regions based on the larger NUTS1
		regions, of which they are a part. This is particularly useful for
		clarity when focusing on specific regions and also because NUTS1
		regions don't vary over time whereas NUTS2 regions do.
	</p>
	<p>
		By default all NUTS2 regions are selected. The globe button toggles
		a menu where you can select which NUTS1 regions you want to show or
		filter out.
	</p>
	<p>
		The selected NUTS2 regions can be highlighted or filtered using the
		toggle next to the globe icon: - highlighting is useful to focus the
		attention on the trends for the desired regions while still being
		able to see them all; - filtering is useful to isolate trends for
		the desired regions. When filtering, the colour scale on the left is
		updated to reflect only the values of the active trends.
	</p>

	<h4>Toolbar: absolute values vs ranking</h4>

	<p>
		You can use the toggle in middle of the toolbar to choose between
		showing absolute values or the values of the region rank: this
		second mode helps seeing how a region changed its positioning
		relatively to other regions.
	</p>

	<h4>Toolbar: color scales</h4>

	<p>
		We provide two color scales for your convenience, that you can set
		using the switch on the right of the toolbar.
	</p>

	<h3>Geographic distribution page</h3>

	<p>
		This page can be reached either by clicking on a dot in the
		Indicators page or by clicking on one of the dots of the timeline
		when looking at the trend for a particular indicator.
	</p>

	<h4>Map</h4>

	<p>
		On the left there is a
		<Link
			href={choroplethURL}
			isBold={true}
			theme={linkTheme}
			type='external'
		>
			choropleth
		</Link>
		showing the indicator values on a map of the UK for the NUTS2
		regions in that year.
	</p>
	<p>
		Gray regions indicate that there is no data available for that
		region.
	</p>
	<p>
		The map shows cities with the most research intensive universities
		(those in &quot;TRAC peer group A&quot;). This group has been chosen
		due to its key relevance for BEIS regional policies.
	</p>

	<h4>Bar chart</h4>

	<p>
		On the right there is a bar chart showing the distribution of the
		indicator values for each NUTS2 region in descending order.
	</p>
	<p>
		The national average is also shown, represented by a vertical dashed
		line. This is calculated as the mean of all available values within
		the year shown.
	</p>

	<h4>Toolbar: regional selection</h4>

	<p>
		As in the trends view, it is possible to highlight or filter the
		NUTS2 regions within a certain year by selecting a NUTS1 region and
		using the switch to change selection mode.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the 'Filter' option is selected, the map zooms in on the
		currently selected regions.
	</p>

	<h4>Toolbar: color scales</h4>

	<p>
		We provide two color scales for your convenience, that you can set
		using the switch on the right of the toolbar.
	</p>

	<h3>Metadata and downloads</h3>

	<h4>Indicator metadata and download</h4>

	<p>
		Both in the trends page and in the geographic distribution pages,
		clicking on the &quot;i&quot; icon at the right of the page title
		shows an info panel reporting the indicator metadata (data
		provenance, date of processing, etc).
	</p>
	<p>
		In that same panel there is a button to download a 
		<Link
			href={csvWikiURL}
			isBold={true}
			theme={linkTheme}
			type='external'
		>
			CSV file
		</Link>
		of the current indicator.
	</p>
	<p>The panel can be dismissed by clicking on the page background.</p>

	<h4>Downloading all indicators</h4>

	<p>You can download all data in the tool for your own use.</p>
	<p>
		Please click on the download icon at the top-right corner of the
		website header to download a zip file containing the CSV files of
		all of the indicators.
	</p>
	<p>
		That zip file also contains an extra CSV file (titled
		<code>{allNUTS2IndicatorsCsvName}</code>) containing all datapoints of all
		indicators in a single file.
	</p>

	<h4>Extras</h4>

	<p>
		Some indicators have been created for NUTS3 and LEP, but these are
		not provided in the tool, nor they are official and should be
		considered as non-official extras:
		{#each availableDownloadIds as availableId, index}
			<Link
				download
				href='/data/{basename}_{availableId}.csv'
				isBold={true}
				theme={linkTheme}
			>
				{availableId}
			</Link>
			{#if index < maxIndex},{/if}
		{/each}.
	</p>

	<h3>Version, changelog and feedback</h3>

	<p>
		In the top-right corner, you will find the version number of the
		tool (currently <code>{version}</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		Clicking on the version number will navigate to a list of all the
		notable changes introduced in each version of the tool on GitHub.
	</p>
