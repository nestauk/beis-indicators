## Navigating the app

### Structure of the page

In the upper part of the screen you have a navigation bar divided in two sections:
- on the left you have various links to navigate the app
- on the right you have:
	- a link to download a zip file containing all the indicators data
	- a link to the app information
	- the app version, linked to its change log on GitHub
	- a button to toggle the accessibility menu

In the lower part of the screen there's the content area, where content depends on the page you're in.

### Toggling the accessibility menu

Clicking the accessibility icon should:
- open the menu if it was closed,
- close it if it was open.

When the menu is open it should appear at the center of the screen sligthly toward the bottom.
