## Navigating the app

### Structure of the page

In the lower part of the screen you have a navigation bar with, from the right:
- an icon with three lines (a so-called "hamburger") to open the navigation menu
- the accessibility icon, to toggle the accessibility menu
- the name of the current page

### Navigating to a new page

Clicking on the hamburger should show a list of links to navigate to other pages.

### Toggling the accessibility menu

Clicking the accessibility icon should:
- open the menu if it was closed,
- close it if it was open.

When the menu is open it appears below the navigation bar, near the thumb.
