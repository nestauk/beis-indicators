## How to explore the indicators

### Sidebar

Here you will find a list of indicators, grouped by theme sections. These are:

- Public R&D
- Knowledge exchange and university commercialisation
- Private R&D
- Places attracting R&D firms and workers

Clicking on the name of an indicator will navigate to the trend view for that indicator.


### Indicators page

#### Temporal distribution

On the upper part you can see a representation of the temporal coverage for each available indicator.

Each circle represents that data for an indicator is available for that year.

Click on it to the navigate to that indicator for that specific year.

#### Timeline

On the lower part, the timeline shows a list of all years where there is data available for at least one indicator.


### Trends page

#### Trends

Here you will see a set of trend lines, with each line showing the indicator value for one NUTS2 region over time (where data is available).

Hovering over a trend line highlights the trend and shows the value of the data point nearest to the pointer.

#### Timeline

The Timeline shows one white dot for each year that the indicator is available. In this view, the timeline is interactive. Clicking on a dot navigates to a map showing the geographic distribution of the indicator for that year.

#### Toolbar: regional selection

The trend lines shown correspond to NUTS2 regions, however it is possible to select and filter regions based on the larger NUTS1 regions, of which they are a part. This is particularly useful for clarity when focusing on specific regions and also because NUTS1 regions don't vary over time whereas NUTS2 regions do.

By default all NUTS2 regions are selected. The globe button toggles a menu where you can select which NUTS1 regions you want to show or filter out.

The selected NUTS2 regions can be highlighted or filtered using the toggle next to the globe icon.

Highlighting is useful to focus the attention on the trends for the desired regions while still being able to see them all.

Filtering is useful to isolate trends for the desired regions. When filtering, the colour scale on the left is updated to reflect only the values of the active trends.

#### Toolbar: absolute values vs ranking

You can use the toggle in middle of the toolbar to choose between showing absolute values or the values of the region rank: this second mode helps seeing how a region changed its positioning relatively to other regions.

#### Toolbar: color scales

We provide two color scales for your convenience, that you can set using the switch on the right of the toolbar.

### Geographic distribution page

This page can be reached either by clicking on a dot in the Indicators page or by clicking on one of the dots of the timeline when looking at the trend for a particular indicator.

#### Map

On the left there is a choropleth showing the indicator values on a map of the UK for the NUTS2 regions in that year.

Gray regions indicate that there is no data available for that region.

The map shows cities with the most research intensive universities (those in "TRAC peer group A"). This group has been chosen due to its key relevance for BEIS regional policies.

#### Bar chart

On the right there is a bar chart showing the distribution of the indicator values for each NUTS2 region in descending order.

The national average is also shown, represented by a vertical dashed line. This is calculated as the mean of all available values within the year shown.

#### Toolbar: regional selection

As in the trends view, it is possible to highlight or filter the NUTS2 regions within a certain year by selecting a NUTS1 region and using the switch to change selection mode.

When the 'Filter' option is selected, the map zooms in on the currently selected regions.

#### Toolbar: color scales

We provide two color scales for your convenience, that you can set using the switch on the right of the toolbar.

### Metadata and downloads

#### Indicator metadata and download

Both in the trends page and in the geographic distribution pages, clicking on the "i" icon at the right of the page title shows an info panel reporting the indicator metadata (data provenance, date of processing, etc).

In that same panel there is a button to download a CSV file  of the current indicator.

The panel can be dismissed by clicking on the page background.

#### Downloading all indicators

You can download all data in the tool for your own use.

Please click on the download icon at the top-right corner of the website header to download a zip file containing the CSV files of all of the indicators.

That zip file also contains an extra CSV file (titled beis_indicators_0_0_18.NUTS2.csv) containing all datapoints of all indicators in a single file.

#### Extras

Some indicators have been created for NUTS3 and LEP, but these are not provided in the tool, nor they are official and should be considered as non-official extras: LEP , NUTS2 , NUTS3 .

### Version, changelog and feedback

In the top-right corner, you will find the version number of the tool (currently 0.0.18).

Clicking on the version number will navigate to a list of all the notable changes introduced in each version of the tool.

Should you find bugs or have ideas about how to enhance this tool, please don't hesitate to send your feedback: click on the "Feedback" link to navigate to a short survey and our contact details.
