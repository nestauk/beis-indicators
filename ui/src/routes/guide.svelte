		<h1>How to explore the indicators</h1>

		<!-- main -->
		<h2>Indicators page</h2>

		<h3>Time coverage</h3>
		<p>On the right you will find a representation of the temporal coverage for each available indicator.<p>
		<p>Each circle represents that data for an indicator is available for that year.<p>
		<p>Click on it to the navigate to that indicator for that specific year.<p>
		<p>The timeline below shows a list of all years where there is data available for at least one indicator.<p>

		<h3>Sidebar</h3>
		<p>Here you will find a list of indicators, grouped by theme sections. These are:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Public R&D capability</li>
			<li>Business R&D capacity</li>
			<li>Knowledge exchange</li>
			<li>Place potential</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Clicking on the name of an indicator will navigate to the trend view for that indicator.<p>

		<!-- trends -->
		<h2>Indicator trends</h2>

		<h3>Timeline</h3>
		<p>The Timeline shows one white dot for each year that the indicator is available. In this view, the timeline is interactive. Clicking on a dot navigates to a map showing the geographic distribution of the indicator for that year.<p>

		<h3>Trends</h3>
		<p>Here you will see a set of trend lines, with each line showing the indicator value for one NUTS2 region over time (where data is available).</p>
		<p>Hovering over a trend line highlights the trend and shows the value of the data point nearest to the pointer.</p>
		<p>You can use the toggle in the top-right corner to choose between showing actual values or the rank of each region.</p>

		<h3>Regional selection</h3>
		<p>The trend lines shown correspond to NUTS2 regions, however it is possible to select and filter regions based on the larger NUTS1 regions, of which they are a part. This is particularly useful for clarity when focusing on specific regions and also because NUTS1 regions don't vary over time whereas NUTS2 regions do.</p>
		<p>By default all NUTS2 regions are selected. The globe button toggles a menu where you can select which NUTS1 regions you want to show or filter out.</p>
		<p>The selected NUTS2 regions can be highlighted or filtered using the toggle next to the globe icon.</p>
		<p>Highlighting is useful to focus the attention on the trends for the desired regions while still being able to see them all.</p>
		<p>Filtering is useful to isolate trends for the desired regions. When filtering, the colour scale on the left is updated to reflect only the values of the active trends.</p>

		<h3>Indicator info and download</h3>
		<p>Clicking on the "i" icon at the right of the page title shows an info panel reporting the indicator metadata (data provenance, date of processing, etc).</p>
		<p>In that same panel there is a button to download a <a href={csvWikiURL}>CSV file</a> of the current indicator.</p>
		<p>The panel can be dismissed by clicking on the page background.</p>

		<!-- map -->
		<h2>Geographic distribution</h2>

		<p>This page can be reached either by clicking on a dot in the Indicators page or by clicking on one of the dots of the timeline when looking at the trend for a particular indicator.<p></p>

		<h3>Map</h3>
		<p>On the left there is a choropleth showing the indicator values on a map of the UK for the NUTS2 regions in that year.</p>
		<p>Gray regions indicate that there is no data available for that region.</p>
		<p>The map shows cities with the most research intensive universities (those in "TRAC peer group A"). This group has been chosen due to its key relevance for BEIS regional policies.</p>

		<h3>Bar chart</h3>
		<p>On the right there is a bar chart showing the distribution of the indicator values for each NUTS2 region in descending order.</p>
		<p>The national average is also shown, represented by a vertical dashed line. This is calculated as the mean of all available values within the year shown.<p>

		<h3>Regional selection</h3>
		<p>As in the trends view, it is possible to highlight or filter the NUTS2 regions within a certain year by selecting a NUTS1 region and using the switch to change selection mode.</p>
		<p>When the 'Filter' option is selected, the map zooms in on the currently selected regions.</p>

		<h3>Indicator info and download</h3>
		<p>The "i" icon at the right of the page title has the same function described in the Trends section above.</p>

		<h2>Downloading all indicators</h2>

		<p>You can download all data in the tool for your own use.<p>
		<p>Please click on the download icon at the top-right corner of the website header to download a zip file containing the CSV files of all of the indicators.</p>
		<p>That zip file also contains an extra CSV file (titled <code>beis_indicators_{version}.csv</code>) containing all datapoints of all indicators in a single file.</p>

		<!-- feedback -->
		<h2>Version, changelog and feedback</h2>

		<p>In the top-right corner, you will find the version number of the tool (currently <code>{version}</code>).</p>
		<p>Clicking on the version number will navigate to a list of all the notable changes introduced in each version of the tool.</p>
		<p>Should you find bugs or have ideas about how to enhance this tool, please don't hesitate to send your feedback: click on the "Feedback" link to navigate to a short survey and our contact details.</p>
