		<h1>How to explore the indicators</h1>

		<!-- main -->
		<h2>Indicators page</h2>

		<h3>Temporal coverage</h3>
		<p>
			On the right you will find a representation of the temporal coverage
			for each available indicator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each circle represents that data for an indicator is available for
			that year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Click on it to the navigate to that indicator for that specific
			year.
		</p>
		<p>
			The timeline below shows a list of all years where there is data
			available for at least one indicator.
		</p>

		<h3>Sidebar</h3>
		<p>
			Here you will find a list of indicators, grouped by theme sections.
			These are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Public R&D capability</li>
			<li>Business R&D capacity</li>
			<li>Knowledge exchange</li>
			<li>Place potential</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Clicking on the name of an indicator will navigate to the trend view
			for that indicator.
		</p>

		<!-- trends -->
		<h2>Indicator trends</h2>

		<h3>Timeline</h3>
		<p>
			The Timeline shows one white dot for each year that the indicator is
			available. In this view, the timeline is interactive. Clicking on a
			dot navigates to a map showing the geographic distribution of the
			indicator for that year.
		</p>

		<h3>Trends</h3>
		<p>
			Here you will see a set of trend lines, with each line showing the
			indicator value for one NUTS2 region over time (where data is
			available).
		</p>
		<p>
			Hovering over a trend line highlights the trend and shows the value
			of the data point nearest to the pointer.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can use the toggle in the top-right corner to choose between
			showing actual values or the rank of each region.
		</p>

		<h3>Regional selection</h3>
		<p>
			The trend lines shown correspond to NUTS2 regions, however it is
			possible to select and filter regions based on the larger NUTS1
			regions, of which they are a part. This is particularly useful for
			clarity when focusing on specific regions and also because NUTS1
			regions don't vary over time whereas NUTS2 regions do.
		</p>
		<p>
			By default all NUTS2 regions are selected. The globe button toggles
			a menu where you can select which NUTS1 regions you want to show or
			filter out.
		</p>
		<p>
			The selected NUTS2 regions can be highlighted or filtered using the
			toggle next to the globe icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			Highlighting is useful to focus the attention on the trends for the
			desired regions while still being able to see them all.
		</p>
		<p>
			Filtering is useful to isolate trends for the desired regions. When
			filtering, the colour scale on the left is updated to reflect only
			the values of the active trends.
		</p>

		<h3>Indicator info and download</h3>
		<p>
			Clicking on the "i" icon at the right of the page title shows an
			info panel reporting the indicator metadata (data provenance, date
			of processing, etc).
		</p>
		<p>
			In that same panel there is a button to download a
			<Link
				href={csvWikiURL}
				isExternal={true}
				theme={{color: theme.colorMain}}
			>CSV file</Link>
			of the current indicator.
		</p>
		<p>The panel can be dismissed by clicking on the page background.</p>

		<!-- map -->
		<h2>Geographic distribution</h2>
		<p>
			This page can be reached either by clicking on a dot in the
			Indicators page or by clicking on one of the dots of the timeline
			when looking at the trend for a particular indicator.
		</p>

		<h3>Map</h3>
		<p>
			On the left there is a choropleth showing the indicator values on a
			map of the UK for the NUTS2 regions in that year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gray regions indicate that there is no data available for that
			region.
		</p>
		<p>
			The map shows cities with the most research intensive universities
			(those in "TRAC peer group A"). This group has been chosen due to
			its key relevance for BEIS regional policies.
		</p>

		<h3>Bar chart</h3>
		<p>
			On the right there is a bar chart showing the distribution of the
			indicator values for each NUTS2 region in descending order.
		</p>
		<p>
			The national average is also shown, represented by a vertical dashed
			line. This is calculated as the mean of all available values within
			the year shown.
		</p>

		<h3>Regional selection</h3>
		<p>
			As in the trends view, it is possible to highlight or filter the
			NUTS2 regions within a certain year by selecting a NUTS1 region and
			using the switch to change selection mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the 'Filter' option is selected, the map zooms in on the
			currently selected regions.
		</p>

		<h3>Indicator info and download</h3>
		<p>
			The "i" icon at the right of the page title has the same function
			described in the Trends section above.
		</p>

		<!-- download -->
		<h2>Downloading all indicators</h2>
		<p>
			You can download all data in the tool for your own use.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please click on the download icon at the top-right corner of the
			website header to download a zip file containing the CSV files of
			all of the indicators.
		</p>
		<p>
			That zip file also contains an extra CSV file (titled
			<code>{allNUTS2IndicatorsCsvName}</code>) containing all datapoints
			of all indicators in a single file.
		</p>

		<h3>Extras</h3>

		<p>
			Note that some indicators have been created for NUTS3 and LEP, but
			these are not provided in the tool, nor they are official and should
			be considered as non-official extras:
			{#each availableDownloadIds as availableId, index}
				<Link
					href='/download/{availableId}'
					isExternal={true}
					theme={{color: theme.colorMain}}
				>
					{availableId}
				</Link>
				{#if index < maxIndex},{/if}
			{/each}.
		</p>

		<!-- feedback -->
		<h2>Version, changelog and feedback</h2>

		<p>
			In the top-right corner, you will find the version number of the
			tool (currently <code>{version}</code>).
		</p>
		<p>
			Clicking on the version number will navigate to a list of all the
			notable changes introduced in each version of the tool.
		</p>
		<p>
			Should you find bugs or have ideas about how to enhance this tool,
			please don't hesitate to send your feedback: click on the "Feedback"
			link to navigate to a short survey and our contact details.
